.init is the neovim init file, to be placed in .config/nvim/

Vim Plugins that need some additional installation steps are:
* [vim-plug] (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
* fzf.vim
* ack.vim (need to install thesilversearcher(ag) package via package manager)
* YouCompleteMe 
* solarized, need to set the terminal colorscheme too, i think i used [dircolors-solarized] (https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized)

A more detailed installation manual will follow once i need to setup my environment the next time
