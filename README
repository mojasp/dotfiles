.init is the neovim init file, to be placed in .config/nvim/

Vim Plugins that need some additional installation steps are:
	- fzf.vim
	- ack.vim (need to install thesilversearcher(ag) package via package manager)
	- YouCompleteMe 
	- solarized, need to set the terminal colorscheme too, i think i used https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized

A More detailed installation manual will follow once i need to setup my environment the next time
